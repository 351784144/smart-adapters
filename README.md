Smart Adapters Library
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrmans0n/smart-adapters.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrmans0n/smart-adapters)

Android library project that intends to simplify the usage of Adapters for ListView/GridView and RecyclerView. You won't have to code any boring adapter again!

It helps to keep boilerplate to a minimum and adds the possibility of easily changing between BaseAdapter / RecyclerView.Adapter adapter styles without changing any code. It also allows painless usage of multiple models / view types for the same list or grid - just add the different mappings between model objects and view objects.

Formerly part of [nl-toolkit](https://github.com/mrmans0n/nl-toolkit).

Adding to your project
----------------------

Add this to your dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'io.nlopez.smartadapters:library:1.0.1'
```

Usage
-----

### Adapter creation

If we got the typical list with one object mapped to one view, for example Tweet -> TweetView, it's as simple as this:

```java
SmartAdapter.items(myObjectList).map(Tweet.class, TweetView.class).into(myListView);
```

**Note** that we have to prepare a bit the view (TweetView in this case). Please read the "Preparing your view classes" section.

If we need to do a more complex list, with different models mapped to different views, we just have to add more `map` calls. Here is an example:

```java
SmartAdapter.items(myObjectList)
    .map(Tweet.class, TweetView.class)
    .map(String.class, ListHeaderView.class)
    .map(User.class, UserView.class)
    .into(myListView);
```

You can pass an AbsListView based control (ListView, GridView) or a RecyclerView to the `into` methods. The class will use the appropriate adapter class depending on which control you pass in there.

We can change the `items(...)` call for `empty()` if we want an adapter initialized with an empty array.

The calls from before return the adapter, so if you want to store it for manipulating it afterwards you can do it. For example:

```java
MultiAdapter adapter = SmartAdapter.empty().map(Tweet.class, TweetView.class).into(myListView);

// We can add more stuff. The list will update and refresh its views.
adapter.addItems(moreItems);

// And delete it if we want!
adapter.clearItems();
```

### Preparing your view classes

All your view classes must inherit BindableLayout<YourModelClass> so we got a common entrypoint for binding the model data to the view.

```java
public class TweetView extends BindableLayout<Tweet> {

    public TweetView(Context context) {
        super(context);
        initView();
    }

    public void initView() {
        // Here we should assign the layout, inflate the views (or use butterknife or something similar), etc.
        // [...]
    }

    @Override
    public void bind(Tweet tweet) {
        // In here we assign the model information values to our view widgets

        // Examples:
        tweetText.setText(tweet.getText());
        authorText.setText(tweet.getAuthor());

        // and so on!
    }
}
```

A nice side effect is that we can pretty much switch back and forth to using ListView or RecyclerView without having to change anything in these views. We also got some more granular control over the events for those view widgets. We could pretty much add different onClick events to the row, to some button inside of it, etc.

We can notify the listener with some specific calls to be able to handle the events wherever the adapter is being instantiated, instead of doing it all inside the view code (which would be pretty messy).

```java
    public void bind(MyModel model) {
        // Set a global click handler
        setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                notifyItemAction(ROW_PRESSED);
            }
        });
        favoriteButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                notifyItemAction(FAVORITE_PRESSED);
            }
        });
    }
```

### Assigning listeners

If we want to control any event in our view classes at the adapter level, we can do it. We just have to add a listener to the adapter, and it could be done when instantaiting it or after.

For example:

```java
SmartAdapter.items(myObjectList)
    .map(Tweet.class, TweetView.class)
    .listener(myViewListener)
    .into(myListView);
```

The listener would be like this:

```java
myViewListener = new ViewEventListener<Tweet>() {
    @Override
    public void onViewEvent(int actionId, Tweet item, View view) {
        // actionId would be any constant value you used in notifyItemAction.
    }
};
```

### Advanced usage with custom builders

If we want to display different cells depending on the data of a single model or something more convoluted, we can specify our own BindableLayoutBuilder interface for the classes to be instantiated.

Here we have an example of a custom BindableLayoutBuilder created for Android Annotations support (which is included in the library as well):

```java
public class AABindableLayoutBuilder implements BindableLayoutBuilder {

    @Override
    public BindableLayout build(ViewGroup parent, Mapper mapper, Class aClass, Object item) {
        try {
            Class modelClass = (item == null) ? aClass : item.getClass();
            Class viewClass = mapper.get(modelClass);
            Method method = Reflections.method(viewClass, "build", Context.class);
            return (BindableLayout) method.invoke(null, parent.getContext());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong creating the views", e);
        }
    }
}

```

We can add it to the adapter like this:

```java
SmartAdapter.items(myObjectList)
    .map(Tweet.class, TweetView_.class)
    .listener(myViewListener)
    .builder(new AABindableLayoutBuilder())
    .into(myListView);
```

The idea behind this is that you can, given the object and its class, create the view class by yourself and return to the adapter.

Common issues
-------------

If you are already using RecyclerView in your project and have problems compiling, you can try setting the transitive property to false:

```groovy
compile ('io.nlopez.smartadapters:library:1.0.1') {
    transitive = false
}
```
